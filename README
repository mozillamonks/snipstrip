snipstrip.py
------------

snipstrip.py is a command-line tool to split up images of comic strips into
individual frames. This is useful to read comics on handheld devices such as
mobile phones, PDAs and handheld multimedia players.

Usage:
------
$ python snipstrip.py <filename> [...]

where arguments are the image files in the *current* directory (as of this
release, sorry).

This script will create files named 00-<filename> to NN-<filename> in the
current directory (where NN is the number of frames in the comic strip.

TODO:
-----
- Improve command line:
    a. should not require the comic-strip file to be in the current directory.
    b. should be able to specify output directory
    c. should be able to specify a template for output directory
- Add code for downloading and splitting webcomics, given a URL.
- Distutils-lify the script
